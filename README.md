# My-Drop-Box

## Due to class's policy, I cannot public the code. Please reachout privately at [leonardotran2108@gmail.com]

In this project, I will apply the cryptographic primitives introduced in class to design and implement the client application for a secure file sharing system. 
Imagine something similar to Dropbox, but **secured with cryptography** so that the server cannot view or tamper with our data.

The client will be written in **Golang** and will allow users to take the following actions:

1. Authenticate with a username and password;

2. Save files to the server;

3. Load saved files from the server;

4. Overwrite saved files on the server;

5. Append to saved files on the server;

6. Share saved files with other users; and

7. Revoke access to previously shared files.


Outcome: **Top 5%** submission of the class (+1 SD above the mean) 

What if we have more time?: 
- Add more security edge test cases 
- Increase efficiency 
- Fix revocation bugs.
